# Performance Test Thresholds Configuration
#
# This file defines the performance thresholds used to validate test results.
# Adjust these values based on your environment and performance requirements.
#
# Note: GitHub Actions runners have different resources than local machines,
# so you may need different threshold files for different environments.

# Maximum allowed median response time (in milliseconds)
perf.max.median.response.time=260

# Maximum allowed error rate (in percentage, e.g., 1.0 = 1%)
perf.max.error.rate=1.0

# Minimum required throughput (in requests per second)
perf.min.throughput=19

# Maximum allowed 90th percentile response time (in milliseconds)
perf.max.p90.response.time=18000
